# Return "recent downloads" to the dock on mac

I accidentally deleted my recently added Downloads files from the dock, in the bottom right. Using the method below, I also added Desktop to my dock.

> Choose Home from the Finder's Go menu, drag the Downloads folder to the Dock, control-click it, and change the options as desired. The Recent Downloads shortcut is to it.
