# BigQuery storage models

- **Logical storage** is the default billing model
- **Physical storage** is a newer billing model

- Key differences:
    - Billing
        - Logical storage bills based on uncompressed size, while physical storage bills based on compressed size. Â 
        - Physical storage can be [significantly cheaper](https://medium.com/cts-technologies/bigquery-storage-billing-models-c2fc48aa8d13) than the logical size, especially for data that compresses well.
    - Time travel:
        - Logical storage includes time travel storage at no additional cost.
        - Physical storage charges for time travel separately.

- Query to determine storage savings (requires `roles/bigquery.admin` role)
